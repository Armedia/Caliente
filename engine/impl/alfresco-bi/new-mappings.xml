		RULES: 
			1)	As soon as a target attribute has been written to, it cannot be
				over-written by another rule
			2)	As soon as a rule matches, the attribute copy is performed with no
				further attempts to match rules
			3)	Rules are matched in the order declared, with explicitly-defined rules
				superseding any defaulted values (by aggregation and re-ordering)
			4)	Extension loops are forbidden (obviously)
			5)	named-mappings.name, type-mappings.name and secondary-mappings.name must
				be globally unique
