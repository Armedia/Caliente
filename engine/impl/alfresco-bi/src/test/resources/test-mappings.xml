			This directive tells the engine that if there's no mapping, the
			attribute should still be preserved as a residual property. This
			should generally live in the <common-mappings> section though
			it may make sense to only apply it based on type/secondary or even
			named rule sets.  This is a flag that's enabled for processing, and
			can be turned on or off

		RULES: 
			1)	As soon as a target attribute has been written to, it cannot be
				over-written by another rule

			2)	As soon as a rule matches, the attribute copy is performed with no
				further attempts to match rules, and no transformation of the content
				
				* If the source attribute is multivalued and the target is not,
				  comma-concatenation is performed
				* If the source attribute is not multivalued and the target is,
				  values will be separated using the value of the separator attribute
				  (the default is the comma)

			3)	Rules are matched in the order declared, with explicitly-defined rules
				superseding any defaulted rules (i.e. the most specific rule wins)

			4)	Rule set extension loops are forbidden (obviously)

			5)	named-mappings.name, type-mappings.name and secondary-mappings.name must
				be globally unique, to avoid confusion
