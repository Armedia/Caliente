Parsing a simple line: easy peasy, we know what to do
	- Unknown flags are unrecoverable errors
	- Out-of-scheme flags (too many args, too few args) are errors
	- Repeat flags add parameter values (and increase ocurrence count?)
	- Positionals are preserved

Parsing a command:
	- First out-of-scheme non-flag (string) parameter is the name of the command.
	- Flags are checked against both the command's scheme's flags, and the global scheme's flags
	- Rest is same as a simple line

Parsing a dynamic with command support:
	- Augmentations are given access to all parameter values parsed so far,
	  to help in the decision and selection of new parameters to search for
	- First out-of-scheme non-flag (string) is a possible name of a command (ONLY the first),
	  and triggers a "command scheme search" (i.e. getCommandScheme(String))
	- Flags are checked against both the command's scheme's flags (if a command is active), and
	  the overall scheme's flags
	    - Every unknown flag triggers a scheme augmentation on either the command scheme (if a
	      command is active) or the global scheme (if no command is active)
		- If the augmentation results in no changes, then this is an unrecoverable error
	- Out-of-scheme flags (too many args, too few args) are errors
	- Repeat flags add parameter values (and increase ocurrence count?)
	- Positionals are preserved
